# README.md

## unofficial, following another page
The purpose is just setting up a repo.

Follow scripture data found at [tanach.us](https://tanach.us/). That site did not endorse this coding attempt. Intend to eventually make some software to support those scriptures.

## Priority of technology

There is good administration at church. The priorities of spiritual programs result in open source tech being a lower priority, and in turn, doing personal coding. Some web pages were found that began to look like admin as they list Christian projects, but these were not used, as the content was not checked and authors unknown - [christian-projects](https://github.com/mattrob33/christian-projects), [christian\_foss](https://github.com/meichthys/christian_foss), [Spanish awesome\_list\_faith\_tech\_materials](https://github.com/mpraes/awesome_list_faith_tech_materials)
