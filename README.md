# README.md

## Purpose

The repo essentially copies some scriptures from other pages.

The content is not checked for accuracy since it was not known how to read Hebrew and Greek at this time. Even though not checked, content in repo facilitates software programs reading from this location, as part of checking.

Software on this site will eventually move to its own separate repo.

Initial Hebrew and Greek scriptures will be coming from different web servers. Thus, git submodules may be used to merge content from the different sites.
