# README.md

## Purpose

The repo essentially copies scriptures from other pages and may add supporting material and software.

Some content was not spot checked like the Hebrew and Greek files, since it was not known how to read those langauges at this time. Even though not checked, content in the repo facilitates software programs reading from this location, part of checking those files.

git submodules are being tried to divide scriptures received from different sites and also separate software from scriptures, etc.
