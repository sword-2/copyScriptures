# README.md

## unofficial, following another page
The purpose is just setting up a repo.

Follow scripture data found at [tanach.us](https://tanach.us/). That site did not endorse this coding attempt. Intend to eventually make some software to support those scriptures.

## Priority of technology

Administration of open source tech may not be a priority when compared to other spiritual goals. If tech is not a priority, it is more practical to do own coding. Some web pages were found that began to list open source projects, but these were not used as the content was not checked - [christian-projects](https://github.com/mattrob33/christian-projects), [christian\_foss](https://github.com/meichthys/christian_foss), [Spanish awesome\_list\_faith\_tech\_materials](https://github.com/mpraes/awesome_list_faith_tech_materials)
