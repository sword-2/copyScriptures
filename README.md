# README.md

## unofficial, following another page
The purpose is just setting up a repo.

Follow scripture data found at [tanach.us](https://tanach.us/). That site did not endorse this coding attempt. Eventually software planned to support those scriptures.

## Priority of technology

There is very good administration at church. With a lot of spiritual programs, open source tech may be a lower priority, and in turn, personal coding. Some web pages were found that began to look like admin by listing Christian projects, but the content was not checked and authors unknown - [christian-projects](https://github.com/mattrob33/christian-projects), [christian\_foss](https://github.com/meichthys/christian_foss), [Spanish awesome\_list\_faith\_tech\_materials](https://github.com/mpraes/awesome_list_faith_tech_materials)
