# README.md

## Purpose

The repo just copies some scriptures from other pages.

The content is not checked since it was not known how to read Hebrew and Greek yet. Even though not checked, loading content to repo facilitates software programs reading it from the repo, as part of checking.

Software co-located with scriptures should be ignored as it will eventually move to its own separate repo.
